      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Mariam, 20 years old. I'm studying software engineering at Ariel University.

I decided to build a movie website because I'm personally a big fan of movies in general, and I spend most of my time watching them. Building this website was an opportunity for me to learn how to create movie websitesÂ better.</p>
